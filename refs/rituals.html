              <p>
                The word pawiwahan comes from the Sanskrit word 'wiwaha' which
                means marriage or marriage. The meaning of this ceremony is the
                ratification of marriage in husband and wife bonds. Marriage is
                an inner and outer bond between a man and a woman as husband and
                wife with the aim of forming a happy family (household), so that
                in Balinese it is termed Grahastasrama, namely the period of
                marriage. The wedding ceremony is also called 'nganten'. The
                word 'nganten' means kanti which in Old Javanese means ally,
                friend so that the word 'anganti' means accompanying and the
                word 'sakanti' means ally or befriended. the word 'kanti' after
                getting the suffix '-an' is juxtaposed with the word 'kanten'
                which means fellowship or friendship. After that, this word gets
                a nasal or nasal sound of 'ng' to become 'nganten' which means
                to live together as husband and wife.
